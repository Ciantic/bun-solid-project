# SolidStart

Everything you need to build a Solid project, powered by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com);

## Start example project

```
bun install
bun --bun run dev
```

Notice, it will **not work** if you use:
```
bun run dev
```
because vinxi will then try to use node.exe instead of bun.exe.
